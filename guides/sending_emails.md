## Sending emails

Rails' Action Mailer allows you to send emails from your application using mailer classes and views. Mailers work very similarly to controllers. They inherit from `ActionMailer::Base` and live in `app/mailers`, and they have associated views that appear in `app/views`.

We will do mainly two things:

1. Create the email message
2. Send the email in a specific moment (when the incident is created)

### IncidentMailer

Let's create the IncidentMailer that will be responsible of sending emails related to Incidents.

~~~bash
rails g mailer IncidentMailer
  create  app/mailers/incident_mailer.rb
  create  app/mailers/application_mailer.rb
  invoke  erb
  create    app/views/incident_mailer
  create    app/views/layouts/mailer.text.erb
  create    app/views/layouts/mailer.html.erb
  invoke  test_unit
  create    test/mailers/incident_mailer_test.rb
  create    test/mailers/previews/incident_mailer_preview.rb
~~~

Look at the most important files, `application_mailer.rb`, `mailer.html.erb`, and `incident_mailer.rb`. Notice that they are very similar to controllers!

~~~ruby
# app/mailers/incident_mailer.rb

default from: 'incident_reporter@example.com'

def new_incident(incident)
  @incident = incident
  mail(to: "police@example.com", subject: 'A new Incident just reported')
end
~~~

`mail` - The actual email message, we are passing the `:to` and `:subject` headers in.

Just like controllers, any instance variables we define in the method become available for use in the views.

#### Create the template view

Create the file `app/views/incident_mailer/new_incident.html.erb`. This will be the template used for the email, formatted in HTML:

~~~ruby
<h1>Hello Policeman!</h1>

<p>
  There is a new <%= @incident.category.name %>, please check it out <%= link_to "at this link", incident_url(@incident) %>.
</p>
<p>
	Bye!
</p>

<p>
	------
	<br>
	The Incident Reporter Rails App
</p>
~~~

To use the helper `incident_url` we must tell the mailer the host to which we make the request. Unlike controllers, mailers know nothing about the incoming requests.

Add this line to the `development.rb` initializer.

~~~ruby
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }
~~~

### Create the Observer

What is an **Observer**? Observer classes respond to life cycle callbacks to implement trigger-like behavior outside the original class. This is a great way to reduce the clutter that normally comes when the model class is burdened with functionality that doesnâ€™t pertain to the core responsibility of the class.

Add this line to the `Gemfile`

~~~ruby
gem 'rails-observers'
~~~

and `bundle install`.

Create the file `app/observers/incident_observer.rb` and write this code:

~~~ruby
class IncidentObserver < ActiveRecord::Observer

end
~~~

Tell your app that the observer exists: add this line to `application.rb`

~~~ruby
config.active_record.observers = :incident_observer
~~~

and restart the server.

#### Send the email

Add this method to the `IncidentObserver`:

~~~ruby
def after_create incident
	# Send the email to police@example.com
	IncidentMailer.new_incident(incident).deliver_later
end
~~~

### How do we test/preview the email?

Go on `localhost:3000/rails/mailers`. This is very useful to preview the email body.

Edit the file `test/mailers/previews/incident_mailer_preview.rb`

~~~ruby
def new_incident
	IncidentMailer.new_incident(Incident.first)
end
~~~

For testing the delivery of the message you could use a real email address for the recipient (but it will soon cause problems...) or you can *catch* the message before it is actually sent.

#### Mailcatcher

Install `gem install mailcatcher`, configure the app for using it and go to `localhost:1080` to see the emails.

Add this to the `development.rb`

~~~ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { address: "localhost", port: 1025 }
~~~
